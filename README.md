How to Compile and Run
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the MSP430 development tools installed, including msp430-elf-gcc.
Connect the MSP430G2553 microcontroller to your computer.

Compilation
Open a Terminal: Navigate to the directory containing the source files (main.c, button.c, timer.c, delay.c, buzzer.c), header files, and the Makefile.

Compile the Code: Run the following command to compile the code:

bash
make
This will use the Makefile to compile the code with the specified flags and target MCU (MSP430G2553). It will create an ELF file named main.elf.

Upload and Run
Follow the instructions specific to your development environment or programmer to upload the main.elf file to the MSP430G2553 microcontroller. Once uploaded, reset the microcontroller to start playing the theme of Lord Gwyn.
